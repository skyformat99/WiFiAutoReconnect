# WiFiAutoReconnect
A c-language program can auto reconnect to the wifi which was specified using netsh when net was disconnected.

## How to use
1. Compile after changing the WiFiSSID, CheckServer and CheckInterval;
2. Add the program to "Start-up".

## Be careful
1. The WiFi you specified must be no password or saved;
2. The WiFi must existed.

**Or you will never connect to the net! :)**
